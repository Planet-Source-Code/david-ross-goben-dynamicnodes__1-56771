The TestWithClassesLocal folder contains a sample program that runs DynamicNodes
    through the wringer. It also shows how to employ the dynNode.cls and
    dynNodes.cls class files themselvesinto a program, rather than depending
    upon DynamicNodes.DLL.

The SpellingCheckerSample folder contains the complete source code for a
    spelling checker with an initial 15000+ word dictionary. The text editor
    is very basic, but it up to you to apply the spell-checker portion to
    a text editor of your own design.

The RegUnreg.reg file modifies your registry so that after double-clicking it
    and installing it, you can right-click COM-based DLL and OCX files from
    within Windows Explorer and and choose the Register or Unregister option
    from the drop-down menu.

The DynamicNodes.DLL file is the ActiveX DLL that supports the Dynamic Nodes
    package.

The DynamicNodes.Doc file is a Word file that contains the documentation for
    available methods and properties of the DynamicNodes package.
    
NOTE: If you do not have Microsoft Word, you can pick up a free Word document
    viewer at www.Microsoft.com. Simply Search for Viewer from their Site
    Search, then select 'Download Converters and Viewers for All Office
    Products', then select 'Word 2000 Viewers', and finally select the
    'Word 97/2000 Viewer' for Win95/98/NT (this is the 32-bit version, which
    any recent computer requires). Currently, the page for downloading this
    is at:

    But this can change, hence the browsing instructions.
