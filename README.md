## DynamicNodes


</div>

### Description

DynamicNodes is a powerful ActiveX library that supports a feature-rich hierarchical list of Node objects. Each node contains a rich set of properties and methods to support a wide variety of projects, from simply storing the headings of a document, the entries of an index, a dictionary, the files and directories of a disk, to being the core of a custom tree-view control. DynamicNodes is capable of holding any information that can be stored in a branching, hierarchal structure. The provided DLL (or class files) supplies a primary Node class, called dynNode, which defines the actual Node objects. It also supports a secondary class called dynNodes, which is a Nodes Collection object automatically instantiated by the dynNode class whenever a new Node is created. This collection class is used to store references to potential sub-nodes for its associated Node object.
